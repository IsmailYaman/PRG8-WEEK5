# Mood analyzer

I made a mood analyzer using the [ML5 faceapi](https://learn.ml5js.org/#/reference/face-api). You train the model on your current mood, which you also give a name. If you have trained a few different moods, you can check them and it will show which mood you have.

This project was made to get familiar with machine learning using Javascript.
